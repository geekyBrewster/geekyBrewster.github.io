## Building this up at my homepage: work-in-progress.

- **July 30, 2017**
  - Stripped everything back to a single HTML page for a simpler landing page
  - No need to include the server side elements yet
- **July 29, 2017**
  - Replaced content w/ digital resume template from weekend assignment
- **May 2, 2017**
  - Added new work in progress inspired by the Big Bang Theory. The functionality isn't fully there yet.
- **March 26, 2017**
  - Moved social media links to top nav bar.
  - Simplified footer to fix issue with it sitting on top of content boxes.
  - Added link to latest project: todo list.
  - Need to fix styling on practice sites and 404 pages.
- **March 24, 2017**
  - Reformatted the image banner and content boxes away from Bootstrap. Would have replaced header and footer bars w/ non-Bootstrap, but I couldn't get it to look how I wanted.
  - Plan to add interactivity with JS soon.
- **March 7, 2017**
  - Moved resume off main page but it remains available.
  - Happy to announce the resume tech challenged helped me get into a web dev bootcamp.
  - Currently redesigning main page to link to various ongoing exercises I'm doing.
  - Suspect form may come first. Styling may come much later.
